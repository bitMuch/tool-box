      Essentially for study, research and development. Unlikely to be of use to anyone at present.

### /* tool-box */
(**web_scrape.py**) :
A friend of mine, shared with me two of his passwords for popular online services. They were both surnames of well known footballers,  with the players jersey number added to the end. 
He is a regular user, and this made sense as each password contained a capital letter, a fair number of characters, included numbers and was easy to remember. 

Finishing up the first few excercises in: Violent Python, by T.J. O'Conner, wanting something a little beefier for a password file than the *"cp /usr/share/dict/words dictionary.txt"* I had initially run, just to get going with the examples.

Thinking about the habits of human behaviour, I remembered my friend and his system. This inspired me to wip up a quick script that would (with the help of BeautifulSoup4) scrape the target data of each teams roster from: http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/eng/2016-2017/faprem.htm, concatonate the players Surname+Number, then write that list to a file.

We grabbed 1068 player names and numbers in all.

Example output:

```
Oxlade-Chamberlain15
Holding16
Iwobi17
Monreal18
Cazorla19
Mustafi20
Sanogo22
Welbeck23
BellerÃ­n24
```

- **To** do: it's sloppy as hell and hardcoded, so clean up, modularize.
- **Bugs**: A few names appeared with some kind of error in encoding. eg. "Granit\xa0Xhaka29"
- *What next?*: commonBabyName+commonDateOfBirth.. nine months after Valentines is supposedly popular, right.


(**zip_crack.py**) :
Takes two arguments a 'password_protected.zip' file and a 'wordlist.txt'

For example:

```
$ ./zip_crack.py treasure_chest.zip dictionary.txt 
[+] Password = secret
$
```

(**kn0wn.py**) :
Prototype of a simple lightweight defensve scanner applet,focused on LAN monitoring.
Currently just loads in a whitelist of known host ip and checks them against an nmap scan.

Example output:

```
--- Summary Of Scan ---------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[G]	KNOWN	192.168.1.254	>>>	BThomehub.home
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[G]	KNOWN	192.168.1.64	>>>	User-PC.home
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[R]	UNKNOWN	192.168.1.66	>>> hp-laptop.home
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[G]	KNOWN	192.168.1.75	>>>	kindle-97bm28000.home
-----------------------------------------------------------------
```

Much-bits to add.
